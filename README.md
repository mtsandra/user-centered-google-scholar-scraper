# web-scraping-academic

This GitHub Repository hosts my ongoing project that scrapes a Google Scholar user profile and does analysis on the article names, scholar info, co-authors info. The web scraping part is written with ```BeautifulSoup```. The project aims to help me with grad school research and hones my coding skills in general.

Current progress: completed the function to scrape author info, co-author info, and all the articles written by the author.
